Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.\n Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.",

You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.\nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured.

Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\n- Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can design nate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.\n- Place magic mouth in two locations.\n- Place stinking cloud in two locations.

The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment.

During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.

As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target's gear melds into the new form.

If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers.

Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

You can also create one of the following effects of your choice:\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow a maximum of twenty creatures you can see to get all their points and you dispel all effects affecting them, as described in greater restoration spell.\n- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For example, you can immunize yourself and your companions against the attack of the Lich draining.\n- You cancel a recent event unique by requiring a new replacement jet diced any jet made during the last round (including your last turn). The reality is transformed to match the new launch. For example, a wish spell can cancel a successful saving throw enemy critical strike an opponent or ally saving throw missed. You can impose a jet with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose to use the new result of the start or the old.\nYou can also do other things than the above examples. Describe your wishes to your MD in the most accurate way possible. The DM is free to determine what happens in this case; more desire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong. This spell may simply fail, the effect you want might be only partially executed, or you may suffer from unpredictable consequences depending on your formulation wish. For example, want an enemy died could propel you to a future time when your enemy is no longer alive, you effectively eliminating the game. Similarly, desiring a legendary magical object or artifact could carry you instantaneously in the presence of the current owner of the object.\nStress to cast this spell to produce an effect other than the reproduction of another spell weakens you. After undergoing this tension every time you cast a spell, and this until your next extended rest, you suffer 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level.

The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow a maximum of twenty creatures you can see to get all their points and you dispel all effects affecting them, as described in greater restoration spell.\n- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For example, you can immunize yourself and your companions against the attack of the Lich draining.\n- You cancel a recent event unique by requiring a new replacement jet diced any jet made during the last round (including your last turn). The reality is transformed to match the new launch. For example, a wish spell can cancel a successful saving throw enemy critical strike an opponent or ally saving throw missed. You can impose a jet with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose to use the new result of the start or the old.\nYou can also do other things than the above examples. Describe your wishes to your MD in the most accurate way possible. The DM is free to determine what happens in this case; more desire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong. This spell may simply fail, the effect you want might be only partially executed, or you may suffer from unpredictable consequences depending on your formulation wish. For example, want an enemy died could propel you to a future time when your enemy is no longer alive, you effectively eliminating the game. Similarly, desiring a legendary magical object or artifact could carry you instantaneously in the presence of the current owner of the object.\nStress to cast this spell to produce an effect other than the reproduction of another spell weakens you. After undergoing this tension every time you cast a spell, and this until your next extended rest, you suffer 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage can not be reduced or avoided in any way. In addition, your Force falls to 3, if it is not already less than 3, for 2d4 days. For each day spent resting or practicing a minor activity, your recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, you have a 33% chance of never being able to cast the spell if you wish undergoes stress.",
